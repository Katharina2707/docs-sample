# User API

Welcome to the **User API** repository. This project provides a RESTful interface for managing user data, built using the OpenAPI 3.0 specification.

The API allows you to:
- **List all users** (`GET /v1/users`)
- **Create a new user** (`POST /v1/users`)

It returns and accepts data in JSON format and follows standard HTTP response codes.

## Getting Started

To learn how to authenticate and make your first API request, see the **Getting Started Guide**.

## Endpoints

To learn about the endpoints and the components, see the **Users Guide**.
