# Getting Started

This document helps you authenticate and make your first API request to retrieve or create user data.

## Authentication

If your API requires authentication, you will need to include an Authorization header in your requests. For example:

```yaml
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN
```
Replace 'YOUR_API_TOKEN' with your actual token.
